# Digging Game

This is a small project to try out the Odin programming language.

The game will be based around digging for ores and minerals in a procedurally generated world.

## Building the game

To build the project, simply invoke the odin compiler with either the client or server package:

```
odin build client
```
or:
```
odin build server
```
